I used the following notations:
x[]--------> Solution list.
matrix[] --> connection matrix of my Graph
k----------> Vertex to be coloured
m----------> number of colours used.
n----------> number of nodes in my graph

The main method calls mColor where the color is assigned to a node, before that, the 
function nextValue is used to find the appropriate color for that node.

I plotted the grpah using networkx library.
There are 2 options, min colours or num. of colours as user's choice.
Min colors is calculated by Degree of grpah.
